# Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

# Introduction
## Purpose
This SRS lists requirements of a basic design of the DHBW Community Dashboard application in its conceptional entirety. This includes functionalities that provide information for DHBW students' ongoing semester such as canteen menu tables or course schedules and administrative functionalities that allow special users (e.g. course representatives) to administrate some information for their associated user groups.

This SRS does not try to initially and foresightedly define each and every functionality that we want to include to the dashboard, but claims to deliver a set of the most crucial requirements to enable us to design and implement a working and desirable application for the DHBW students.

Since this document contributes to an agile project, it itself is agile in nature. It is growing with the project in detail and extent and stays open towards deeper insight from our experiences with the subject.

## Scope
With the DHBW Community Dashboard we want to offer a tool specified for the organizational needs of DHBW Karlsruhe students. The software intends to enable the students to access their schedule and other course specific events provided and maintained by their elected course representative. It furthermore tries to funnel any information associated with DHBW campus life. 

Hence the scope of this software project is to setup the full stack of a progressive web application that serves the aforementioned purpose.

# Overall Descripiton
The DHBW Community Dashboard will be designed to **serve the needs of DHBW students** regarding their time management and everyday life at the university. The students do often face changes in their schedule and need to communicate such changes via different tools such as Moodle or Discord. To give an example, the Community Dashboard will offer the right calendar based on course affiliation of the specific student and will furthermore notify the users if any changes have been made to their calendar. We also want to give special rights to the course representatives, such that they can administer course specific information for their fellow students.

**Overall, we can divide our project into three aspects:**
- **Personalized tool**: DHBW Community Dashboard gives the students one tool for their time management as a reliable source of truth
- **Superuser modification**: letting specific users administrate information for their fellow students to minimize the individual, organizational efforts
- **Campus matters**: giving access to interesting information regarding the student’s everyday life

Represented by the associated user role these aspects are also depicted in our [overall use case diagram](../use_case_diagrams/UCD1_overall.png).
