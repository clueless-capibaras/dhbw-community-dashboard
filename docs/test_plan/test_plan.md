# Test Plan

# Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the test effort.

This Test Plan for the DHBW Community Dashboard supports the following objectives:
- list items that should be targeted by the tests
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts

# Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation
## Background
brief description of the background surrounding why the test effort defined by this Test Plan will be undertaken. 
Include information such as the key problem being solved, 
the major benefits of the solution, 
the planned architecture of the solution, and a 
brief history of the project. 
Where this information is defined in other documents, you can include references to those other more detailed documents if appropriate. 

## Evaluation Mission
- find as many bugs as possible
- find important problems, assess perceived quality risks
- advise about perceived project risks
- certify to a standard
- verify a specification (requirements, design or claims)
- advise about product quality, satisfy stakeholders
- advise about testing
- fulfill process mandates 
- and so forth
Each mission provides a different context to the test effort and alters the way in which testing should be approached

## Test Motivation
quality risks, technical risks, project risks, use cases, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, design elements, suspected failures or faults, change requests, and so forth
