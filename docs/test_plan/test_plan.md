# Test Plan

# Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the test effort.

This Test Plan for the DHBW Community Dashboard supports the following objectives:
- list items that should be targeted by the tests
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts

# Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation
## Background
Since the formation of capyclue. and especially the DHBW Community Dashboard kickoff, our aim has always been to please the needs of our users by delivering a consistent application.
Providing a pleasent straight-forward user experience while still covering all necessary features with as much information and detail as possible is our highest priority.
To achieve this goal, the DHBW Community Dashboard should be free from bugs or any kind of malfunction. This includes every component that is planned for our final release.
During the developing process, we evaluated the importance of certain functionalities, which led to the decision of focusing on especially the Calendar and Canteen component.
The [Software Requirement Specification (SRS)](../software_requirements_specification/software_requirement_specification.md) provides more information on these components.

## Evaluation Mission
- find as many bugs as possible
- find important problems, assess perceived quality risks
- advise about perceived project risks
- certify to a standard
- verify a specification (requirements, design or claims)
- advise about product quality, satisfy stakeholders
- advise about testing
- fulfill process mandates 
- and so forth
Each mission provides a different context to the test effort and alters the way in which testing should be approached

## Test Motivation
quality risks, technical risks, project risks, use cases, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, design elements, suspected failures or faults, change requests, and so forth
